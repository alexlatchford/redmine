# Redmine Integration

In here contains the bits required to turn a vanilla installation of redmine into an installation of Lifeguard!

*What is Lifeguard?*

Lifeguard is the other name for "NOC in a box", i.e. a set of software applications that can be combined together so you can run a Network Operations Center anywhere. 

*Why Redmine?*

It came close with a lot of features that were found to be early requirements and had a robust plugin architecture that is hoped will be flexible to accept future enhancements.
